      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Refreshing, rich, and full of character, bread kvass is a true taste of tradition. This naturally fermented drink boasts a deep, 
        malty aroma with a subtle sweetness and a gentle fizz that makes every sip incredibly satisfying. Crafted from rye bread, 
        it carries a hint of caramelized grains, balanced by a light tanginess that awakens the palate. Whether enjoyed chilled on a hot summer day 
        or paired with a hearty meal, kvass is both invigorating and nostalgic—a perfect blend of bold flavor and natural refreshment that keeps you coming back for more.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 lb of bread</li>
        <li>12⅔ cup of water (chlorine-free)</li>
        <li>⅔ cup of sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant bread yeast</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut the bread into crouton-sized cubes. Toast them in the oven at 350 F for 20 min. Toss halfway through to ensure even browning. 
          The goal is to caramelize the sugars, so toast as long as necessary.</li>
        <li>Place the toasted bread cubes in a large bowl. Bring the water to a boil, and pour it over the bread. Let the bread soak for at least 4 hours (up to 24 hours). 
          You want to extract the malted sugars into the boiling water. </li>
        <li>Strain liquid into a fermentation container (see notes for options). It's recommended to do this by pouring the liquid through a cheesecloth-lined strainer, 
          then wringing the wet bread to get all the liquid out.</li>
        <li>Stir the sugar and yeast into the liquid. Add any additional flavors at this point.</li>
        <li>Leave the kvass to ferment in a warm location to ferment for around 1 week. It will start to foam and bubble significantly after 6-12 hours.</li>
        <li>After one week, strain the kvass into plastic pop bottles or swing-top beer bottles and store them in the fridge. 
          The kvass will continue to ferment and will build up pressure, so use bottles that can handle the carbonation. Pop the lid every few days to test the carbonation.</li>
        <li>It will be ready to drink after 3 days in the fridge. However, it will continue to ferment for another 1-2 weeks until all the sugars 
          have been consumed by the yeast. At that point, it will no longer be sweet and it will have reached its full alcohol content.</li>
      </ol>
