# macbheatha's odin-recipes project

## What is it?
This is my first project on the course. It contains three recipes of my favourite foods and beverages. Feel free to check and try it!

## What skills have I practiced when making it?
Well, basic html-ing and css-ing :D
I digged deeper and included few tags and css selectors that I haven't yet seen on the curriculum, but felt very passionate to google and discover.
